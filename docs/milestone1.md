# Data Interactions

   Although search engines such as Google can be used to find charities, our web app aims to centralize the search for charities. Since milestone 0, we have weeded out some features and clarified our vision for the Charitable app. We have our features list and then a separate “stretch goals” list (features that are beyond the requirements of this project but we want to explore if we have time). 
   
  Features: 
  * A search engine for charities 
    - We will be using a charity API (or database) for this. 
  * Search filters to narrow down a user’s search 
    - Fields (based on the API) may include: charity name, street address, state, zip code, rating, IRS information, etc
  * Information profiles about charities
    - Our search result will return multiple information profiles?
    - Profiles include information such as location, rating (if available), financial information, etc 
  * User Accounts 
    - Username and password 
    - First and last name 
    - Age, gender, profile picture, contact information, location 
  * Favoriting 
  * Likes 
   - Users can like posts of other users 
  * Written reviews 
    - “upvote” written reviews of other users??
  * User Posts: users can create curated lists of charities (ex: a list of cat-related charities)
    
  Stretch goals: 
  * verification for charities
  * recommended charities
  * Visual themes (Eid, Ukraine, etc)
