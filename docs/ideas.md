# Innovative Idea:
Our idea is to construct a charity searching app. There are many search engines that can be used to search for charities (e.g. google) but few of them are specific to only charities. Our site will be specific to charities and therefore have a lot of available information about them immediately available. More specifically, we will provide information regarding how much money the charities take in and spend each year, as well as how long they have existed and other factors to contribute to some sort score regarding how "good" (to be defined) a particular charity is.
