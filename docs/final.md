Our web application
Although search engines can be used to find charities, our web application aims to centralize the search and provide users with 
Instagram charity 
social justice new generation 


Our idea is to construct a charity searching app. There are many search engines that can be used to search for charities (e.g. google) but few of them are specific to only charities. Our site will be specific to charities and therefore have a lot of available information about them immediately available. More specifically, we will provide information regarding how much money the charities take in and spend each year, as well as how long they have existed and other factors to contribute to some sort score regarding how "good" (to be defined) a particular charity is.

The few charity searchers that do exist are not very personalized. Given this, we will include functionality that allows users to favorite charities, creating lists of their prefered charities. We will also add a "for you" type page which based on past searches and favorited charities lists some charities that may appeal to that particular user. We will also try and include local charities (amherst) that may not otherwise get attention.

Important Components:
Since the main function of this website is to search for charities, we will include a seach bar that will use a charity API to retrieve its results. We will also have other features such as: personalized for you page/recommended, likes, favorites, star and written reviews, badges/verification for charities, charity information profiles, share charities (kinda like a retweet and or share to other platforms, themes for events (like eid).
